## Description

Write code to analyze the financial records of a company. Given an array of data, we need to extract certain data and calculate totals, averages and highest and lowest months profit.

##Â Challenges

This was very challenging for me. We'd learned how to iterate through an array in class but I needed to research how to then work with that to extract certain data from the array and then calculate the needed figures using that data. We had the added complexity of the data being in a multidimensional array. Unfortunately I ran out of time before I could complete the challenge.

## What I Learned 

I learned a lot about arrays during this challenge. I discovered there are multiple ways to iterate through an array. I also learned about the Math object in Javascript which I used to round numbers to two decimal places.
